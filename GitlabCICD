Benefits of Using gitlab CICD
- since all the source code stays in the git, Allows keepin CI/CD and code managment in the same place
- No need seperate tool.
- self-Hosted or Managed application, where as in jenkins we need to have seperate server/infra for that
    - jenkins only have self-hosting application.
