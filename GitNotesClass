what is git 
git is Distributed version control 

SCM:- source code management

first we create a MVP
Adding new features, features are not working properly


code keeps changing based on thre requirements and bug issues reported
How to track when multiple developers works on same project 
  - who made the changes
  - what changes are made
  - when the changes are made

In order to solve this we need a version control which will record all these data.
- git is one of them, git tracks all these changes
     
pre-step ::- install the git


1. First step is convert our directory under the git control 
   intialize
   git init 

2. we have the option to track only required files
    configure files to track

3. once you done with changes, git creates a version of the file named :- commits 
   git commit is used to create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history

git status ::- will show all the untracked files in the current folder
               intially it show all the untracked files since we did't added any files

git add . :: - will add all the files to the git
git add file1 file2 file2 :- will add those files

Now execute git status :- will show respective files to be tracked

whenever we modify a file , that file become unstaged , we need to stage that file by using git add <unstaged file>

commit 
git commit -m "Intial commit"
- m indicates the message

once commited it will change the version of the repository

#Local and Remote repository
local copy is named git local repository
remote copy is named git remote repository ::- one way to host is using the open-source vesion and else we have hosted solutions like
bitbucket,github 
GitHub :- is the remote server which manages the git reposiotries 


Now we are done with git init,add and commit , Inoder to push the changes we need a remote repository
We need to create a remote reposiotry in the github/bitbucket

To add the remote repository to local
git remote add <name> <git https URL>
git push -u <name> master

#Every user have there local repository git clone/pull
Inoder to have a local copy for a differenet user, we need to clone the repository
git clone <URL>

git pull :- will pull the latest changes to the repository
